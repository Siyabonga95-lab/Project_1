        <p>
            I am a college students who has a passion for anime, art, 
            and storytelling.I  bring something different to the table — 
            from animation and design to writing scripts and composing music.

            My main goal is to prove that with hardwork and dedication, students 
            can produce something on the same level as professional creators. 
            I also hope this project will inspire others to start their own creative 
            journeys and collaborate across skills.
