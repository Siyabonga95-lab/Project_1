            <h1>Project Proposal: Cosmic Duel of Light and Shadow</h1>
        </header>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This proposal is for an anime project called <strong>Cosmic Duel of Light and Shadow</strong>. 
            The idea is to create a short anime series (3 episodes for the pilot season) that mixes 
            action, drama, and science fiction. The story focuses on two ancient cosmic powers — 
            Light and Shadow — locked in a battle that could decide the fate of countless worlds.
            The aim of this project is to bring together creative students, amateur voice actors, 
            and artists to produce something original that can be shared both locally and online.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Significance of the Project</h2>
        <p>
            Anime is a growing form of entertainment worldwide, but many young creators 
            don't get the chance to showcase their work in a professional-looking format. 
            This project will not only give us experience in animation production, 
            but it will also give fans new content to enjoy. It can help build 
            connections between students and the anime fan community, and maybe 
            even open opportunities for bigger projects in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            The main problem is that local creators often lack funding, 
            equipment, and a proper platform to release their work. 
            Even when the talent is there, without exposure or collaboration 
            opportunities, ideas stay as just ideas. This project is a direct 
            attempt to solve that problem by pooling resources, sharing skills, 
            and actually completing an anime pilot that can be shown to the public.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Target Audience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Anime fans between the ages of 15 and 35</li>
            <li>Students and young creators interested in animation, voice acting, or music production</li>
            <li>Cosplay communities and fan art circles</li>
            <li>People who enjoy original stories with a mix of sci-fi and fantasy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Budgeting</h2>
        <p>Estimated budget for the pilot season:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Animation Production: R 50,000</li>
            <li>Voice Acting and Sound Effects: R 15,000</li>
            <li>Music Production: R 8,000</li>
            <li>Website and Promotion: R 7,000</li>
            <li>Printing Posters and Merchandise: R 3,000</li>
            <li><strong>Total:</strong> R 83,000</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Cosmic Duel of Light and Shadow is more than just a fun idea — it's 
            a practical opportunity to learn, create, and share. By working together 
            as a team, we can produce an anime pilot that not only tells a great story 
            but also shows what student creators are capable of. If successful, 
            this could grow into a full series and become a platform for even more 
            local talent to shine.
